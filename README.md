Have solved all the 3 questions along with the proof of namedtuples being faster than dict (even for a single run, without averaging) but could not understand how to write the test cases part, so no github actions. :(

Uploads: Colab notebook .ipynb files separately for each question1, 2 and 3: with logs, comments and docstrings.
